## Plugins in ESLint

ESLint is highly extensible and allows the use of plugins to enhance its functionality. Plugins provide additional rules, configurations, or customizations beyond what is included in ESLint core. For example, there are plugins available for specific frameworks like React or Vue.js, plugins for enforcing specific coding styles like Airbnb or Google's JavaScript style guide, and plugins for detecting security vulnerabilities or potential performance issues.

Plugins can be installed alongside ESLint using npm or yarn, and they are configured in the ESLint configuration file (usually named `.eslintrc`).
