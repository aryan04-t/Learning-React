# Understanding JSX

## JSX (JavaScript XML)

**JSX** stands for **JavaScript XML**. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write code that looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript. JSX is commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX is not HTML, nor is it JavaScript directly; it is a syntactic sugar that gets transpiled into regular JavaScript by tools like Babel before it is executed in the browser.


## XML (eXtensible Markup Language)

**XML** stands for **e**Xtensible **M**arkup **L**anguage. It is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML is often used for data interchange between different systems and for structuring data in web applications.


## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML defines the structure and layout of a web document by using a variety of tags and attributes. Web browsers interpret HTML documents and render them as web pages for users to view.


## HTML and XML both are mark-up languages, but both have their own functionalities, tags wise the major difference between HTML and XML is this: 

- **HTML**: Employs a set of predefined tags for structuring content, such as `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, etc., each with specific meanings and rendering behaviour.
- **XML**: Allows users to define custom tags and document structures tailored to their specific needs, offering flexibility in data representation and exchange.

* and this extensible behaviour of XML lets JSX look like HTML but function like JS once it is transpiled by Babel from JSX to JS.
