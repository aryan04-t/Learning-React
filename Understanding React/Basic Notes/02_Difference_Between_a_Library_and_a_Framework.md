# Difference Between a Library and a Framework

## Library

- **Definition**: A collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common tasks.
- **Control**: Developers control the application flow, calling the library as needed.
- **Example**: **React** - Provides tools for building UIs but does not dictate the entire application structure.

## Framework

- **Definition**: A comprehensive platform providing a skeleton for building applications.
- **Control**: The framework manages the flow of the application, calling the developerâ€™s code.
- **Example**: **Angular** - Offers a complete solution including data-binding, form validation, and routing, enforcing specific architecture and design patterns.
